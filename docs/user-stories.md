# Smart TODO App User Stories

In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of features of a software system.


## MVP

1. As a user, I want to have my own TO DO list divided into categories (to buy, to read, to eat, to watch), so I can easily organize the items.

2. As a user, I want to be able to insert an item, and have it auto categorized into the existing categories to avoid delays.

3. As a user, I want to be able to change a category of an item so I can correct it in case it was mis-categorized or could not be categorized at all.

4. As a user, I want to be able to mark my items as done so I can track the progress of my list.

## STRETCH

1. Stretch - As a user, I want to be able to drag and drop my items into another category so I can easily change its category.

2. Stretch - As a user, I want to be able to delete an item so my list doesn't become too long.

3. Stretch - As a user, I want to be able to edit an item so I can change and correct its description.

4. Stretch - As a user, I want to reorder the items of a category so I can see the most important ones first.

5. Stretch - As a user, I want to Hhide completed items, so I can focus on what is left to do.
